# Westhoughton Boxing Club website

Project - User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website to promote a local boxing club. It serves as an advertisement for the club. It gives information about opening times, activities and schedules and contact details, whilst also providing a platform for new and current customers.
 
## UX
Two page site – both pages scrolling down to equivalent of 2-3 desktop pages.
Mobile version condenses each page to a single column. First/Home page provides details of activities and acts as an advertisement providing positive imagery plus information about who the club is aimed at and what activities are available.
Second page provides contact details, a map and a ‘contact us’ form, plus further positive imagery.

### User Stories

1. As a user I would like to know what type of boxing club this is. Who is it aimed at?  ie Adults, children etc.

* The home page scrolls to reveal class times for both adults and children. The nav bar also has options for both ‘Adults’ and ‘Children’. Both are links to the relevant sections lower down the page.

2.  As a user I would like to know when the club is open.

* Page two provides opening and closing times for all days of the week.  

3. As a user I would like to know where the club is located.

* Page two of the site has a map at the top of the page showing the location of the club. The address and contact details are also listed underneath. A ‘Contact’ option is also given in the nav bar linking to the top of page two.

4. As a user I would like to know if boxing lessons are available and, if so, how to go about booking a lesson/lessons.

* Page one of the site gives regular lesson times for both adults and children and has a ‘book now’ button which links to the Contact Us form on page 2.

### Wireframes
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file 
in the project itself (in a separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
