# Westhoughton Boxing Club website

Project - User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website to promote a fictional local boxing club. It serves as an advertisement for the club. It gives information about opening times, activities, schedules and contact details, whilst also providing a platform for new and current customers.
 
## UX
Three page site – all pages scrolling down to equivalent of 2-3 desktop pages.
Mobile version condenses each page to a single column. Home page provides details of activities and acts as an advertisement providing positive imagery plus information about who the club is aimed at and what activities are available.
Second page provides contact details, a map and a ‘contact us’ form, plus further positive imagery.
Page three provides information about the gym and the various forms of training therein.

### User Stories

1. As a user I would like to know what type of boxing club this is. Who is the club aimed at? 

* The home page scrolls to reveal class times for both adults and children. The nav bar also has options for both ‘Adults’ and ‘Children’. Both are links to the relevant sections lower down the page.

4. As a user I would like to know if boxing lessons are available and, if so, how to go about booking a lesson/lessons.

### Content
- Coding for the re-styled radio buttons within the booking form on the Contact Page was copied and adapted from an educational blog posting on the Markheath.net website (https://markheath.net/post/customize-radio-button-css).
- Narrative for the 'Pads Card' within the 'Gym' page is adapted from the Decathlon Store website "https://play.decathlon.co.uk/articles/why-and-how-to-use-pads".
- The use of Bootstrap Cards on the Gym page was suggested by my Mentor, Marcel. The card implementation was all my own work except for the removal of a small radius at the corners of each of the cards, the code for the styling of which was given by Marcel.  Code given was: style="border-radius: 0px;".
